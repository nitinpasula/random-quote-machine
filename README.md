This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), to build a ["Random Quote Machine"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) for front end library project exercise.

Couple of things that differ from the project requirements are i) instead of 'a' element I used material ui icon ii) quote box is placed in a grid.

For solution that meets the exact requirement, here is the code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/nit-in-code-world/pen/dyoxpEY)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
